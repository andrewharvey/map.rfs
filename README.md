# About
This project is an effort to provide a simple yet usable map of the NSW RFS
Current Fires and Incidents.

# History / Motivation
The initial prototype of this was conceived, designed and built during the
October 17th 2013 bushfires around Sydney.

I, like many other people, was keeping a close eye on the Current Fires and
Incidents map on the RFS web site to gather vital information about where fires
were so I could plan which areas to avoid.

I was frustrated by the tiny map offered on the RFS web site and the poor
usability of the map component. Clicking each marker gave you a popup which
filled the whole map window making it very hard to close again and pan around.

So I set off and quickly hacked together the basics to take the data from their
map and place it on a full screen Leaflet powered map. Currently
map.rfs.nsw.gov.au goes nowhere, so I built the website I expected to get by
going to such address.

This is a very simple almost textbook use of Leaflet and I'm very pleased with
how easy it actually was to get working. 

# Future
There are many potential avenues for further development. Including,

 * Popup on mouse hover
 * Subscribe to updates within an area
 * Stats/overview of current fires
 * Historical data display
