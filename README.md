# About
This project is an effort to provide a simple yet usable map of the NSW RFS
Current Fires and Incidents.

# History / Motivation
The initial prototype of this was conceived, designed and built during the
October 17th 2013 bushfires around Sydney.

I like many other people was keeping a close eye on the Current Fires and
Incidents map on the RFS web site to gather vital information about where fires
were so I could plan which areas to avoid.

I was frustrated by the tiny map offered on the RFS web site and the poor
usability of the map component. Clicking each marker gave you a popup which
filled the whole map window making it very hard to close again and pan around.

Furthermore, it was running off the Google Maps API which is probably costing the
RFS money sent to Google.

So I set off and quickly hacked together the basics to take the data from this
map and place it on a full screen Leaflet map. Currently map.rfs.nsw.gov.au goes
nowhere, so I built the website I expected to get by going to
map.rfs.nsw.gov.au.

This is a very simple almost textbook use of Leaflet and I'm very pleased with
how easy it actually was to get working. There is still lots left to implement
though.

# Work in Progress
This is still very much a work in progress in the coming days I should be able
to quite a few more improvements.
